1. How many tweets are in the collection?
  151,648 tweets

2. When do they start?

3. When do they end?

4. What is the trend for tweet volume?
  I tried to create a histogram with the dates and failed...
  I tried putting a subset of the data in rstudio
  My code is as follows:
  load("C:/Users/Greg/Downloads/tweets1.txt")
  tweets1 <- read.csv("C:/Users/Greg/Downloads/tweets1.csv", comment.char="#")
  View(tweets1)
  as.POSIXct(tweets1$created_at)
  typeof(as.POSIXct(strptime(tweets1$created_at, "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")))
  hist(as.POSIXct(strptime(tweets1$created_at, "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")), "weeks")

5. If you look at the most common words over the lifetime of the search, do you notice any particular trends associated with those words?

  
6. What external events might correspond with the differences in the trends of most common words?

  
7. What hashtags show up as most prominent in each month of the lifecycle?

  
8. Which twitter users are the most mentioned?

  
9. How frequently is each user mentioned during each month of the lifecycle?

  
10. What is the relationship between the volume of tweets you selected and the volume of tweets for other collections in the data set?
  Weather Data Set(job_id = 1160)(my data set) = 151648 tweets
  Superbowl(job_id = 187) = 3290086 tweets
  Tea Party(job_id = 2572) = 3536250 tweets
  World Series(job_id = 2577) = 2525687 tweets
  The Weather Data Set seems really small in comparison to other data sets

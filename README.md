# DataScience_FinalProject

I was unable to do the majority this project. I ran out of time and I have no excuse. I should have started earlier. I did not anticipate the server taking so long after each query. I apologize.

The first data set I chose was the Superbowl data set. (job id = 187) I switched data sets because each query for the Superbowl data took way too long. I first tried to put it in a csv that way I could read it into r, but the data set was too large. That is why I switched to the Weather data set. (job id = 1160)

The Weather data set (job id = 1160) is the data set I stuck with.
